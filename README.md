Desktop Goose but it's a Discord bot! You must host this bot yourself. (Replace the channel id and token)


Steps to set up this bot:

1: Create an application to your liking at https://discord.com/developers/applications

2: Go to the bot page, create bot, and copy the token.

3: Unzip the file and replace the channel id with the id of the channel you want the honking in, and the token with the token you just copied from https://discord.com/developers/applications

4: open the terminal, do cd (folder location) and type "node ."

5: May the honking begin!
